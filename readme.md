SkullDrops
==========

SkullDrops is an extremely simple plugin for bukkit that allows players to receive skulls as drops from dying monsters.

Usage
---------
In the *config.yml*, you can define the drop chance by monster in percent: 100 means the skull will always, 0 it will never drop. If you set `playerKilledOnly` to `true` the skull is only dropped if the entity was killed by a player.

Additionally you can use `/skull <name>` to receive the skull of the given player. This only works for players with the corresponding `skullDrop.skull` permission.
